Hi! I'm Alex. I am a graduate of the Graduate GISci Certificate program at the University of Colorado Denver, and I received my Bachelor of Science (BSc.) in Biology from Northern Arizona University. I have various experience in utilizing geospatial software and technology within the domain of the natural sciences, as well as utilizing GIS to communicate data.

Through both my education and work experience, I have developed a highly specialized knowledge and broad skill set. While I love viewing and exploring the Earth from above, I am fascinated by the tiny interactions which shape our physical and personal environment. My work experience, course work and personal intrigue has allowed me to study these interactions in-depth.

My experiences have provided me with the necessary skills and attention-to-detail needed to effectively communicate important topics, as well as provide reliable, research-quality data to be used across institutions.
